Schumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994. Driving the Benetton B194, which has been called the worst car to have won a Formula One World Championship and was difficult to drive,[55] so much so that Schumacher had three different teammates (JJ Lehto, Jos Verstappen, and Johnny Herbert) due to crashes, Schumacher won the first four races and finished the season with eight wins.[56] He won six of the first seven races, including the Brazilian Grand Prix in which he lapped the entire field,[12] and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race.[33] Schumacher made two pit stops without stalling and finished the race in second place. Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen.[57][58]

The 1994 season was marred by the death of Ayrton Senna, which was witnessed by Schumacher who was directly behind Senna, and that of Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix; there were also allegations of cheating during the 1994 Formula One season involving several teams, most particularly Schumacher's Benetton, having allegedly broken the sport's technical regulations.[59][60] Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari, and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. The McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of launch control that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations; Benetton and Willem Toet, a Formula One aerodynamicist for over thirty years who worked at Benetton until 1994, stated that traction control was legally achieved through rotational inertia. There was no evidence to suggest the software was used.[61]

At the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was penalised for overtaking Hill on the formation lap. He and Benetton then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team.[62] Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix, after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skid block, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed.[63] Benetton protested that the skid block had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb; the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block.[64] The two-race ban punishment was seen by many observers as petty and insignificant, and that it was a result of Benetton feud with the FIA, with Schumacher being a victim and the FIA trying to deny him his first World Championship.[65] These incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race at the Australian Grand Prix. On lap 36, Schumacher hit the guardrail on the outside of the track while leading. Hill attempted to pass but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire.[66] As a result, Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship,[28] the first German to do so—Jochen Rindt (the only posthumous Drivers' Champion) was German but raced under the Austrian flag, and whose domination in 1970 was later equalled by Schumacher.[67] The race stewards judged it as a racing accident and took no action against either driver. Although the Drivers' Championship had been decided in a similar manner in 1989 and 1990,[36] public opinion was divided over the incident,[68][69] and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.[70][71] At the FIA conference after the race, Schumacher dedicated his title to Senna.[72]

Schumacher driving for Benetton in 1995 at the British Grand Prix. That year, he won his second World Championship.
In 1995, Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton, which now had the same Renault engine as Williams; according to Motor Sport author Marcus Simmons, Benetton had the better team, while Williams had the superior car.[73] Schumacher accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Hill. With Herbert as teammate, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship, breaking the dominance of McLaren and Williams, and became the youngest two-time World Champion in Formula One history.[74] The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the British Grand Prix on lap 45, and again on lap 23 of the Italian Grand Prix; it also saw one of his career's best ovetakes, with the one over Jean Alesi giving him the win at the European Grand Prix,[12] after he reduced the half a minute gap in the final dozen laps.[33] Schumacher won 9 of the 17 races, including the French Grand Prix,[65] and finished on the podium 11 times. It was only once that he qualify worse than fourth; at the Belgian Grand Prix, he qualified 16th but nevertheless went on to win the wet-dry race,[75][76] finishing 16 seconds ahead of Hill,[12] with whom he had ferocious wheel-to-wheel racing and involved some crucial strategic calls.[33] His bad qualifying was a result of a crash he had in the final free practice, and by the time his car was rebuilt, it had started to rain; this ended his 56-race streak of outqualifiyng his teammates that started in 1992, after he missed a gear in qualifying in Adelaide in 1991 and was outqualified by Nelson Piquet.[77]

Ferrari (1996–2006)
In 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.[78] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari.[79] Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter, and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles disparaging labels, such as "truck", "pig", and "accident waiting to happen".[80] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.[24] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams like Benetton and Williams.[81] Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship,[82] although afterwards his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 "an awful car", a "piece of junk", and "almost undriveable", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car "wasn't very good".[83] Irvine also later commented: "The '96 [Ferrari] car was a disaster and was nearly undriveable. Only someone of Michael Schumacher's ability − and maybe Senna – could have driven it."[33]

During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.[84] Alesi and Berger were allowed to drive Schumacher's Benetton B195 with which he won the World Championship in 1995, and they could not believe how Schumacher had won with it, calling it "the ugly ducking" for being so ugly to drive and having many crashes.[85][86] In a 1999 interview with his 1994 and 1995 World Championship rival Damon Hill, Schumacher recalled: "You remember when I left Benetton, and [Jean] Alesi and [Gerhard] Berger took their first steps in that Benetton? You remember how many crashes they had? ... I mean, that car was really unbelievable. Really difficult to drive. It was so edgy. But it was fast when you just drove it exactly on that edge. Now, though, there have been a lot of aerodynamic improvements to the cars and so the cars I have driven have been a lot more stable. And that applies to most of the cars today."[87]

Schumacher, Brawn, Byrne, and Jean Todt have been credited as turning the struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history,[88][89] Schumacher became the byword for Formula One and motorsports in general.[36] Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believed the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.[90] At Ferrari, Schumacher scored 72 Grand Prix wins and won five consecutive Drivers' titles from 2000 to 2004.[10] As of 2022, only Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes, both of whom were Schumacher's successor and his career last team, were considered in the same ballpark in terms of dominance and sustained success.[91] According to Brawn, had Schumacher not retired in 2012 and not suffered a skii injury in 2013, he would have had a shot at winning his eight World Championship in 2014.[92] In 2023, Williams team principal James Vowles, who was Mercedes chief strategist during Schumacher's time at the team between 2010 and 2012 and was instrumental in the team's success in the mid-to-late 2010s, said that Schumacher brought Mercedes together. Vowles added: "[Schumacher] also knew his performance was perhaps not quite at the same level, but he made up for it in terms of the amount of work and dedication he put in. From that, Nico learned a lot and conversely, Lewis learned a lot from Nico."[93]

1996–1999: World Championship challenges
"It was not a race. It was a demonstration of brilliance."

Stirling Moss about Schumacher at the 1996 Spanish Grand Prix[94]

In 1996, Schumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship and helped Ferrari to second place in the Constructors' Championship ahead of his old team Benetton. During the season, the car had reliability problems; Schumacher did not finish in 7 of the 16 races. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher took pole position but suffered engine failure on the formation lap.[95] He won three races, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995, despite a poor chassis.[96] He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet.[3] After a bad start, which saw him dropping from third to sixth place,[33] before taking the lead on lap 19, he consistently lapped five seconds faster than the rest of the field in the difficult conditions.[84] At the Belgian Grand Prix, he used well-timed pit stops to fend off Williams' Jacques Villeneuve.[97] He also took first place at the Italian Grand Prix to win in front of the tifosi (Ferrari fans).[98][99]


Schumacher celebrates a second-place finish at the German Grand Prix in 1997, the year he brought Ferrari to a Drivers' Championship challenge.
Schumacher and Villeneuve competed for the title in 1997, despite never sharing a podium and almost never battling directly on the track,[100] in what has been described as the sport's most dramatic and controversial season finale.[101] Villeneuve, driving the superior Williams FW19, led the championship in the early part of the season.[102] Schumacher first win of the season came at the wet Monaco Grand Prix, in which he took a six-second lead after one lap.[33] By mid-season, despite possibily driving not even the second-fastest car on the grid,[103] Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's finale (the European Grand Prix at the Jerez circuit) with a one-point advantage.[104][105] In qualifying, Schumacher set the same fastest lap as Villeneuve and Heinz-Harald Frentzenn. He started in second position as Villeneuve set his fastest lap first but was able to jump him at the start.[106] Towards the end of the race, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he might not finish the race.[107] As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival on lap 48, Schumacher turned in on him but retired from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. Despite public outcry, the race stewards did not initially award any penalty, as they had deemed it a racing incident;[108] two weeks after the race, in an unprecedented move,[109] Schumacher was disqualified from the entire 1997 Drivers' Championship after an FIA disciplinary hearing found that his "manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although deliberate not made with malice or premeditation, it was a serious error."[110][111] Initially feeling wronged, Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake,[70] upon seeing the footage when he got out of the car and adrenaline had worn off.[103] His actions were widely condemned in British, German, and Italian newspapers.[70][71] Another view is that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast; without Schumacher turning into him, he would have overshot the turn and ended up in the gravel.[112][113] In later years, Villeneuve himself admitted that he "would never have made that corner without [Schumacher's] push", and Schumacher stated in 2009 that if he could have his career over again, he would "do some things differently", citing Jerez 1997 as something that he would have changed in his career.[114][115][116]


Schumacher battles with David Coulthard in 1998 at the British Grand Prix. For the second consecutive year, Schumacher lost out the World Championship at the last race.
In 1998, Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen became Schumacher's main title rival. Driving the superior McLaren MP4/13, Häkkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16-point advantage over Schumacher, who then won the Argentine Grand Prix. With the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes.[117] One of his victories was at the Hungarian Grand Prix, a track where overtaking is difficult and that favoured McLaren;[33] Schumacher drove 19 consecutive qualifying-like laps to make Ross Brawn's alternative three-stop strategy work and to go from third to first place.[118] Brawn had told him: "Michael, you have 19 laps to pull out 25 seconds. We need 19 qualifying laps from you."[12] Schumacher ultimately came 9 seconds ahead of David Coulthard.[119] Häkkinen, who started on pole, achieved only a point due to reliability issues.[120] Ferrari took a 1–2 finish at the French Grand Prix, the first Ferrari 1–2 finish since 1990,[121] and at the Italian Grand Prix,[33] which tied Schumacher with Häkkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points.[122][123]

There were two controversies during the 1998 season. At the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start-finish line, and stopped to serve his ten-second stop-go penalty, which was a result of overtaking the lapped car of Alexander Wurz during a safety car period. There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty; because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane,[33] the win was valid.[124] The FIA rescinded the penalty due to taking 31 minuites, rather than within the 25 minutes limit, and rejected McLaren's protest.[12] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray but collided with Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed on the racing line in poor visibility to let Schumacher past. His Ferrari lost a wheel but could return to the pits, although he was forced to retire. Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of "trying to kill" him. Coulthard admitted five years later that the accident had been his mistake.[125][126] From a possible three-point lead, Schumacher was still seven points behind Häkkinen. Heading into the final race, the Japanese Grand Prix, Häkkinen held a four-point advantage over Schumacher, who started on pole but stalled and caused the start to be aborted, which meant he had to start from the back of the field. He made a comeback up to third but retired after hitting debris from an accident.[127] Häkkinen won the Drivers' Championship by winning the final two races despite Schumacher being the polesitter both times,[128][129][130] continuing Ferrari's longest World Championship drought.[131][132][133]

In 1999, Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors' Championship, the team's first title since 1983. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the British Grand Prix at the high-speed Stowe Corner; his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track into the barriers and resulting in a broken leg.[134][135][136] During his 98-day absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo. About his return, Schumacher's Eddie Irvine teammate recalled: "It was amazing. I remember me and Mika Salo were testing at Mugello, which is one of the hardest circuits in the world – and he [Schumacher] hadn't driven for eight months. He got in the car and within a lap he was a tenth or two tenths slower than I was. How do you do that? And then of course a couple of laps later he's half a second quicker and – it's just impossible. It's really really annoying, but it was an honour to be able to see his telemetry and see the things he could do with a car."[33] After missing six races, he made his return at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix, qualifying in pole position with his career's greatest pole margin, with his time faster than Eddie Irvine by almost a second.[33] He then assumed the role of second driver, helping Irvine to victory and assisting his teammate's bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari,[137] with Irvine leading the championship by one point.[138] About Schumacher's role, Irvine stated: "He is not only the best driver in the world, he is also the best number two in the world."[139] In the last race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix, Häkkinen won his second consecutive title after he beat him off the line. Schumacher later said that Häkkinen was "the best opponent I've had" and the one he respected the most.[140][141]

2000–2004: five consecutive World Championships

Schumacher driving for Ferrari in 2001 at the Spanish Grand Prix. The year prior, he had won Ferrari's first Drivers' Championship since 1979.
in 2000, Schumacher won his third Drivers' Championship, his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with Häkkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings.[142] At the German Grand Prix qualifying session, which was largely decided in the opening 10 minutes of semi-dry weather, Schumacher was able to improve his time in the final seconds and qualified second. In the race, he reitired after crashing out at the start, as his new teammate Rubens Barrichello took his maiden win from 18th.[33] Häkkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix, his 41th career win.[33] At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins won by his idol Ayrton Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[143] The championship fight came down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to Häkkinen at the start.[33] After his second pit stop, Schumacher came out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship;[144][145] he later described it as the fight of his life.[146] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as Häkkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that "the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was "the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year". Benson also hailed Schumacher as "unquestionably the greatest driver of his era".[147]

In 2001, Schumacher took his fourth Drivers' title. Four other drivers won races but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship.[148] Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the Spanish Grand Prix, where he won after Häkkinen retired on the last lap due to his car's engine blowing up leading Schumacher to say he was sorry for him and that they had been "bloody lucky";[33] Canadian Grand Prix, where Schumacher finished second to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first-ever 1–2 finish by brothers in Formula One;[149] and the Belgian Grand Prix, in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins that had stood since 1993.[150][151]


Schumacher driving the Ferrari F2002 at the French Grand Prix. It was at this race that he clinched the 2002 Drivers' Championship, setting the record for the fewest races in locking up the title.
In 2002, Schumacher retained his Drivers' Championship. In winning the Drivers' Championship, he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion.[152] Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning 11 times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Barrichello. This pair finished nine of the 17 races in the first two places.[153]

During the 2002 season, there was some controversy at the Austrian Grand Prix,[154] where Barrichello was leading but in the final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.[155] Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or technical regulation,[156][157] as Ferrari did the same at the Austrian Grand Prix the previous year where Schumacher finishe second and Barrichello third,[158] it angered fans and it was claimed that the team's actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators. Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be given wins in only the sixth race of the season, which he would have won anyway, a view also shared by Jean Todt and Ross Brawn in retrospect,[159][160] particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step,[155] and the Ferrari team incurred a $1 million fine for this disturbance.[161] Schumacher vowed to pay back Barrichello, and later that same year returned the favour in several races to help him finish second in the standings.[162][163][164] At the United States Grand Prix, Schumacher returned the favour,[165][166][167] by giving Barrichello the win by 0.011 seconds,[168][169][170] the second-closest margin on the finishing line in Formula One history in a failed dead heat finish.[171][172][173] In an unplanned finish,[174][175] Schumacher's explanation varied between it being him "returning the favour" for Austria, or trying to engineer a formation finish—a feat derided as near-impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second.[176] After the end of the season, the FIA banned "team orders which interfere with the race result";[177][178] the ban was lifted for the 2011 season because the ruling was difficult to enforce.[179]
